## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Significance </b>**

Several health conditions, your lifestyle, your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Some risk factors for heart disease cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control [[Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention]](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm)

Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.

## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Questions </b>**
1. Does sex/gender have an association with heart disease?
2. Is there an association between age & heart disease?
3. Are BMI, Smoking, Alcohol drinking, and prior stroke associated to heart disease?

## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Technologies Used </b>**

### Data Cleaning & Analysis:
The Pandas library will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage:
Our database will be hosted in PostgreSQL, and will be populated from Jupyter Notebook using SQLite.

### Machine Learning
The SciKitLearn machine learning library will be used to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is 70/30. 

### Dashboard
A functioning and interactive dashboard will be created using Tableau to present findings and results.

## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Machine Learning Model - Flow Chart</b>**

we plan to follow the steps of the following machine learning flow chart. This chart is subject to change and will be updated as we dive deeper into our analysis.

## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Communication Protocols </b>**
- Team members will communicate using the #final-project Slack channel.
- Team members will meet at least 1x per week.
- Team members will plan next time they meet at the end of every meeting-- being flexible and open to each other's schedules.
- Team members will communicate with each other in the case they need internal deadline extensions or help with their part of the project.
- Team members will distribute work evenly amongst each other and be repsonsible for their distrib


## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Update on the status of the project </b>**

We have divided the project in several steps that are linked with the way this type of analysis have to be performed:

1- Explore the dataset
2- Transform values and variables
3- Load the data into the model
4- Testing different Machine Learning Model
5- Machine Learning Model Improvements
6- Conclusions and Comunication

### **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>1- Explore the dataset </b>**
Degree of progress: 95% / 100%

We have worked exploring and analyzing the dataset to understand the information and its quality.

## **<span style='color:#0386f7de'>Segment 1 Responsabilities: </b>**

All the members of the team were responsible of preparing the deliverable required by segment 1 and the majority of the work was performed as a group, but the final commit of the information were split as follows:

The definition of the roles are more related to the need of doing that by the deliverable, but the result of the job is based on pure team work in the majority of the aspects:

  - Ivan:       << SQUARE ROLE >>   Performing the Github Repository for the project, creating the branches.
  - Pavel:      << CIRCLE ROL E>>   Uploading the jupiter notebook file and loading up the Database to be used until the end of the project
  - Gustavo:    << TRIANGLE ROLE >> Preparing the final version of the Readme file to submit. Setting up the Flow of the Machine Learning Model.
  - Jhonatan:   << X ROLE >>       Preparison of the slides presentation to be submited.
